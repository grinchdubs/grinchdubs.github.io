## Welcome to the MAIL APRS Bot Guide

Welcome to the MAIL APRS bot! Below you'll find simple instructions on how to use the bot for messaging, group management, and other helpful features.

### Send a Message to a User

To send a message directly to another user, type:

```
@CALLSIGN followed by your message
```

**Example:** `@N0CALL Hey there! How's it going?`

### Check Your Messages

To check your incoming messages, simply type:

```
APRSM
```

The bot will fetch your latest messages.

### Delete Your Messages

To delete messages that you haven't ack'd, simply type:

```
del
```

The bot will delete your unacknowledged messages.

### Automatically Retrieve Messages

If you're actively using APRS and want to automatically retrieve messages while on the air, include one of the following in your comment beacon:

- `APMAIL`
- `ALLMSG`

The bot will monitor your beacons and send your messages as they come in.

### Join a Group

To join a group, use the following command:

```
join group_name
```

**Example:** `join bigfoot`

This will add you to the specified group.

### Leave a Group

If you want to leave a group, simply type:

```
unjoin group_name
```

**Example:** `unjoin bigfoot`

### Send a Message to a Group

To send a message to all users in a group, type:

```
#group_name followed by your message
```

**Example:** `#bigfoot Let's organize the next meetup!`

This will send your message to everyone in the "bigfoot" group.

### Additional Tips

- Group messages are only visible to members of that group
- Group messages are valid for 3 days
- You will automatically leave a group after 1 day
- Individual messages are deleted after 7 days

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need more help. Enjoy using the MAIL bot!

<summary><strong>üìç APSPOT - POTA/SOTA/WWFF Spotting</strong></summary>

## Getting Started

APSPOT supports a number of commands, and depending on what command is sent will depend on how APSPOT responds. To get started with APSPOT, simply send a message "usage" to APSPOT on APRS and as long as you have gone in via a Tx-Enabled APRS IGate (Or you were heard by a Tx-Enabled APRS IGate) the system will reply with a number of messages on how to use the system.

## The Commands

**"usage"**
Replies with the list of usage types of the system.

**"usage \<type\>"**
Replies with basic usage information for each type within the system. Valid types are "aprs", "sms" and "winlink"

Examples: `usage aprs`, `usage sms`, `usage winlink`

**"usage \<type\> \<activity\>"**
Replies with an example message for your activity.

Example: `usage aprs sota` replies with: `EXAMPLE: "! SOTA VK3/VN-030 7.090 CQCQ"`

## Getting Current SPOTs

**"spots \<activity\>"**
Replies with the 3 (SMS/APRS) or 10 (Winlink) most recent SPOTS under the activity you provide. Currently the system supports POTA (from pota.app), SOTA (from parksnpeaks.org) and WWFF (from parksnpeaks.org).

Example: `spots POTA` would return 3 messages via APRS:
```
K0DME | K-1210 | 14057.0 | CW
N9FAL | K-2234 | 14287 | SSB
B3WAV | K-7724 | 14294 | SSB
```

## "spots" Filter Options

The "spots" command has a couple of filtering options:

**Filter by mode:** Add the desired mode onto the end of the command
- `spots pota cw` ‚Äì will return CW POTA spots
- `spots wwff ssb` ‚Äì will return SSB WWFF spots

**Request more spots:** Add a number onto the end of the command
- `spots wwff 5` ‚Äì will return a maximum of 5 WWFF spots via SMS and APRS

**Combine filters:** The mode filter must be specified first
- `spots wwff ssb 5` ‚Äì will return up to 5 SSB WWFF spots

Note: If less than the requested amount of spots are available for the given request ‚Äì only the available spots will be returned.

## Posting a SPOT

**APRS Format:**
```
! <Activity> <Ref> <Frequency In MHz> <Mode> <Comment(Optional)>
```

**Winlink Format (Place in Subject of message):**
```
! <Activity> <Ref> <Frequency In MHz> <Mode> <Comment(Optional)>
```

**SMS Format:**
```
!<Callsign> <Activity> <Ref> <Frequency In MHz> <Mode> <Comment(Optional)>
```

**Note:** For SMS Spotting, please append your callsign immediately after the "!" WITHOUT a space.

### Format Breakdown

- **"!"** ‚Äì Tells the system that you're submitting a SPOT
- **"\<Activity\>"** ‚Äì Currently supported: WWFF, SOTA, POTA, SIOTA
- **"\<Ref\>"** ‚Äì Reference of the Park/Summit/Silo (e.g., WWFF-1929, VK3/VN-008, VK-3024)
- **"\<Frequency in MHz\>"** ‚Äì Frequency in MHz (e.g., 7.144, 14.310)
- **"\<Mode\>"** ‚Äì Supported modes: SSB, CW, FM, AM, DATA (plus FT8 for POTA)
- **"\<Comment\>"** ‚Äì Optional comment (include "test" to prevent actual posting)

### Example Messages

**APRS & Winlink:**
For APRS send the message to "APSPOT" in the callsign field
For Winlink send the message to "apspot@apspot.radio" and place the command in the **SUBJECT** line.

Examples:
- `! WWFF VKFF-1929 7.144 SSB CQCQ`
- `! POTA VK-3024 7.195 SSB CQCQ`

<details>
<summary><strong>üìª CQSRVR - Group Communication</strong></summary>

CQSRVR is an APRS server designed to facilitate initial contact between amateur radio APRS stations (hams) worldwide with similar interests. It is not a messaging server, BBS, or any other type of interactive forum. It is a global service and requires unique callsign-SSIDs to be used.

## Basic Usage

To use CQSRVR, send an APRS numbered message to CQSRVR that looks like:

```
CQ groupname your message here
```

"CQ" and "groupname" are each one word separated by a space, and may be any mix of upper and lower case. "your message here" is the message text you want to be sent to other registered members of "groupname".

## Example

```
AE5PL-10>APRS::CQSRVR   :CQ MYTEST Listening for APRS contacts{01
CQSRVR>APJIC1,TCPIP*::AE5PL-10 :ack01
CQSRVR>APJIC1,TCPIP*::AE5PL-10 :Message has been sent to MYTEST{00
AE5PL-10>APJIC1,qAO,CQSRVR::W5EJL-1  :CQ MYTEST Listening for APRS contacts
```

## Registration and Limits

Every time you send a CQ groupname message to CQSRVR, it "registers" you with that group. You may only send one CQ groupname message per 30 minutes to keep activity manageable.

## Unregistering from a Group

To unregister from a group, send a numbered APRS message to CQSRVR with:

```
U groupname
```

**Example:** `U MYTEST`

If the group is inactive for 12 hours or you are inactive for 12 hours, you will be unregistered automatically.

## Other Commands

- `?` - List all active groups
- `? GROUPNAME` - Reply with how many are in the group
- `L` - List all groups I am a member of

These commands are sent just like the CQ and U commands (the text portion of an APRS message to CQSRVR).

<summary><strong>‚úâÔ∏è EMAIL - Email Gateway Services</strong></summary>

## EMAIL Server (EMAIL)

The easiest way to send email is to send a message to EMAIL with the recipient's email address as the first "word" of the message. You may only send one line messages (67 total characters maximum).

```
Send APRS message "email@address message text" to EMAIL.
APRS Format: URCALL-10>APRS::EMAIL    :urname@urdomain.bogus This is a test.
```

**Note:** Keith Sproul WU2Z retired the EMAIL server in 2019. It has been replaced with a javAPRSSrvr Email Gateway (EMAIL-2).

## javAPRSSrvr Email Gateway (EMAIL-2)

javAPRSSrvr supports email via EmailGate. This server supports the EMAIL method of sending email and supports some new features. EmailGate now properly supports **UTF-8** in both APRS messages and emails.

Currently, EMAIL and EMAIL-2 are the callsigns for the general email servers. Both support delayed delivery of APRS messages and messaging to/from Winlink.

### Creating Shortcuts

To create a shortcut:

```
Send APRS message "shortcut email@address" to EMAIL-2
APRS Format: URCALL-10>APRS::EMAIL-2  :me urname@urdomain.bogus
```

### Using Shortcuts

To use the "me" shortcut from any of your stations:

```
Send APRS message "shortcut message text" to EMAIL-2
APRS Format: URCALL-7>APRS::EMAIL-2  :me This is a test.
```

### Managing Shortcuts

**List all shortcuts:**
```
Send APRS message "shortcut L" to EMAIL-2
```

**Remove a shortcut:**
```
Send APRS message "shortcut R" to EMAIL-2
```

**Note:** Shortcuts are associated with the callsign so each amateur can have their own shortcuts. They can only include alpha and numeric ASCII characters (no punctuation, white space, or Unicode characters).

## Email to APRS Support

Shortcuts may be used by persons on the Internet to send an APRS message to a station via email. The email must meet these requirements:

1. **Must be from** the email address specified in the shortcut
2. **Subject must start** with the station callsign-SSID (all upper case) followed by a colon and message text
3. **Body must contain** the text "**userid:shortcut:**" where "shortcut" is the assigned shortcut

### Example Email to APRS

```
From: urname@urdomain.bogus
To: EMAIL-2 email address
Subject: URCALL-10:Testing email to APRS.
Body:
This is a test userid:me: of APRS email gateway.
Your Name URCALL
```

## Undelivered Message Caching

Some javAPRSSrvr email gateways support unacknowledged message caching. If a valid email goes unacknowledged after 4 tries, you may retrieve cached messages by sending:

```
Send APRS message "get" to EMAIL-2
APRS Format: URCALL-10>APRS::EMAIL-2  :get
```

The `?APRSM` query is equivalent to the get command.

EMAIL-2 supports caching for up to 24 hours and supports both the get command and ?APRSM query.
