Here are 41 even more modern, powerful and lesser-known Linux terminal commands, designed to boost productivity, system monitoring, troubleshooting, and development for linux cli. Most of them replace command you already know. Use aliases to use the old command so it doesn't get annoying. I use these on Nix, Debian and Arch based distros but these should also work with others. These were found from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P-vjgPx9ww) video by NetworkChuck.

#### 🧠 AI Integration in the Terminal:
Tools like Fabric and Olama integrate AI into the CLI for generating, summarizing, or explaining commands.
Example: Ask AI to analyze logs or summarize most-used commands.


#### 💡 Overall Takeaway:
The video emphasizes turning your Linux terminal into a superpowered productivity hub through visual tools, AI integration, better replacements for classic commands, and advanced system monitoring. Perfect for devs, sysadmins, and power users.
Final Note: The creator encourages viewers to comment their favorite commands and "ethically hack" the YouTube algorithm by liking, subscribing, and engaging.
